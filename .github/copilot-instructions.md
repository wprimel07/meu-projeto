# Copilot Instructions for AI Agents

## Project Overview
This is a simple HTML project for learning and demonstration purposes. The codebase consists of static HTML files with basic markup, lists, and links. There is no build system, backend, or external dependencies.

## Key Files
- `index.html`: Main landing page. Contains headings, paragraphs, unordered and ordered lists, and a link to `tebela.html`.
- `tebela.html`: (Not provided in context, but linked from `index.html`). Presumed to contain a table or related content.
- `README.md`: Brief project description in Portuguese.

## Conventions & Patterns
- All content is in Brazilian Portuguese.
- HTML is written in a simple, direct style for educational use.
- Use semantic HTML tags where possible (e.g., `<h1>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`).
- Comments in HTML use `<!-- ... -->` for explanations.
- Links between pages use relative paths (e.g., `<a href="tebela.html">`).

## Developer Workflow
- No build, test, or deployment steps are required.
- To view the project, simply open `index.html` in a web browser.
- No JavaScript, CSS, or external assets are present.

## AI Agent Guidance
- When adding new pages, follow the simple, semantic HTML style.
- Maintain language consistency (Portuguese).
- If creating new links or navigation, use relative paths.
- If updating or fixing HTML, ensure tags are properly closed and nested.
- If adding new features (e.g., forms, tables), keep the markup clear and minimal.

## Example Pattern
```html
<ul>
  <li>item 1</li>
  <li>item 2</li>
</ul>
```
